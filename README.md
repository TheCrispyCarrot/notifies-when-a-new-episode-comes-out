# notifies-when-a-new-episode-comes-out
This is a program that scans a website and notifies you when a new episode of a show is released ans emails you the link

For some time I have been watching the Anime seriese "Black CLover," but now, due to the quarentine,
new episode of the show will no longer be released on the usual schedule. I watch the show on the
website 'wco.tv.' Instead of constantly checing the webiste for a new episode, I have created a program 
to scan the site and send me an email when a new episode is released.

**important:**
In order to use the program for yourself, you will have to insert your browser headers, 
email address, and email password into the program. I have removed my own for privacy.
